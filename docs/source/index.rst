Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

**NewGame** (/lu'make/) is my library of things I love that range from tale as old as time to pirates of Caribbean, the list could be as long as a whole world.
if I type * here to make a word *italic* and *bold* 
and
change to another 
line
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
